# Coral Studio
Coral Studio is a web-based tool for interacting with the Coral server, and observing the connected agents and their interactions.

It also allows you to create a session with agents through the interface, which constructs a POST to the sessions api, which you can copy from your network tab in your browser's developer tools to use in your own application.
