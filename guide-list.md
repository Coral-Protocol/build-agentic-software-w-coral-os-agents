## What is Coral?
Coral is a protocol and solution for production-ready, privacy-preserving and decentralised agentic applications. It allows SaaS applications to quickly and flexibly spin up performant graphs of AI agents, comprising of both open source and proprietary agents developed by the community, companies and individuals.

Coral supports any backend stack, and any agent framework that supports [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP).

Coral has 2 target audiences:
* Application developers who want to build agentic applications. We aim to be the most practical way of building agentic applications (web based or otherwise) and adding agency to existing applications.
* Agent developers who want to build agents, which may be general or hyper specialised, and make those agents available to the Coral ecosystem. In the future, these agent developers will also be able to easily monetise their agents through the Coral ecosystem.

Often times, an application with agentic features will involve a combination of application-specific agents and reusable agents that are hyper optimised for one or more types of tasks. In this list we will aim to make you proficient with both and be in a position to build your own agentic applications with Coral, leveraging existing open source agents, as well as contribute to the Coral ecosystem.

Coral does not provide any framework for coding the agents themselves, we focus on letting agents dynamically interact with each other.

Coral is well-tested with the following agent frameworks:
* [LangChain](https://langchain.com/)
* [CAMEL](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/)
* [CrewAI](https://crewai.com/)
